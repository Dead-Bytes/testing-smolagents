These models performed much better than the base versions, even boosting the domain-specific performance by 2x. • Worked on integrating various LLM’s, VLM’s to our Rust Agentic framework which created perfect abstraction for users to chain the LLM agents On-the-Go. Research Internship July 2024 – August, 2024 Under Dr. Sanjay Kumar Singh IIT-BHU,Varansi • Implemented tiny transformers for Object Recognition tasks and gained an accuracy score of more than 65. • Led efforts to refine Xi-net implementations for microprocessor compatibility, resulting in reduction in energy consumption during classification tasks, optimizing operational efficiency for edge devices in resource-constrained environments. Research Internship Jan. 2024 – Aug. 2024 Under Dr. Pin-Yu Chen (Link) IBM Research,New York • Developed and implemented mathematical models based on research papers to establish benchmarks, writing over 80% of the required Python code. • Submitted our work for EMNLP-25, with me as a First Author and will resubmit at a Major NLP conference in future. Club Coordinator August 2023 - Dec. 2023 Mavericks : The ML Society IIIT Guwahati • Introduced a drive for Machine Learning in the freshers and organized several workshops to deliver my fellow pupils the best ML can offer, held weekly challenges and lectures to empower new ones through peer learning(Link)\n"
